# Two-process model and IPC command reference

This guide elaborates on `AGENTS.md`. If anything here conflicts with `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.md` wins.

## The split

Oarlock is two processes: the Rust backend (`src-tauri/`) and the webview frontend (`src/`).

- **Rust owns all OS access**: PTY, file system, git, shell spawn, network, secrets, workspace authorization.
- **The webview never touches the FS, processes, or shells directly**. Every host operation goes through an `invoke()` call to a command registered in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`.

This boundary is the root of the security model. Untrusted input (terminal escape sequences, file content, AI tool results) is parsed and validated in Rust or in carefully scoped frontend code, never executed by the renderer.

## Adding a new IPC command

1. Write the `#[tauri::command]` async function in the appropriate `src-tauri/src/modules/<area>/` module.
2. Register it in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` inside the `tauri::generate_handler![...]` block.
3. If the command uses a Tauri plugin API (window, clipboard, dialog, etc.), add the plugin permission to `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`.
4. Add a typed frontend wrapper in the matching `src/modules/<area>/lib/` directory and call it through Tauri's `invoke()` API.
5. If the command touches the file system, network, or shell, it must go through the existing guards (`security.ts` deny-list, workspace authorization registry, SSRF guard, AI tool approval).

Custom commands do not need to be listed one-by-one in `default.json`; the capability covers the window. Plugin permissions do.

## Command catalog

The commands registered in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` are grouped below by module. Names are the Rust function names as seen by the frontend.

### PTY (`src-tauri/src/modules/pty/`)

Long-lived interactive terminal sessions.

- `pty_open` - create a new PTY session
- `pty_stream_open` - open the window's multiplexed output stream and receive its token
- `pty_set_presentation` - report which terminals are focused, visible, hidden or occluded (numbered, so a late report cannot undo a newer one)
- `pty_write` - send input bytes (text or control sequences)
- `pty_resize` - resize the PTY
- `pty_close` / `pty_close_all` - destroy one or all sessions
- `pty_has_foreground_process` / `pty_has_foreground_job` - detect whether a command is running
- `pty_authorize_cwd` - authorize the folder a terminal reported (OSC 7) and say whether the page may take it; on Linux and macOS only where the shell or its foreground job really is
- `pty_shell_name` / `pty_list_shells` - shell detection and enumeration
- `pty_diagnostics` - native queue counters for the opt-in terminal diagnostics (`window.__oarlockTermSnapshot()`)

Output streams over the `oarlock-pty` custom URI scheme (one held `poll` request per window), not through `pty_open`; see `pty-transport-v2.md`.

### File system (`src-tauri/src/modules/fs/`)

Every command here that takes a path is refused outside the folders the workspace registry authorizes (see `security-model.md`, "File commands").

#### Tree

- `list_subdirs` - list subdirectories
- `fs_read_dir` - read a directory

#### File

- `fs_read_file` - read file contents
- `fs_write_file` / `fs_save_document` - write file contents; both keep the project trust answer for the app's own calls only, never for `origin: "ai"`, and the AI's gates also refuse the secret-path deny-list natively (`Gates.protect_secrets`). `fs_save_document` takes the content-and-identity version the editor or the AI read and syncs the destination folder after the rename; a committed write whose version cannot be read back returns a `v2:unavailable:` placeholder version, so the next save conflicts and asks
- `fs_stat` - file metadata
- `fs_canonicalize` - canonical path
- `fs_host_path` - host path of a workspace file (WSL share or drive), for asset URLs
- `fs_open_default` - open a file in its default app; a program only after the user clicks Run in a native dialog the backend shows (Return and Escape answer Cancel)

#### Mutate

- `fs_create_file` / `fs_create_dir`
- `fs_rename` / `fs_move` / `fs_delete` / `fs_delete_batch` / `fs_copy` - rename, move, delete and batch delete guard the authorized entry (resolved parent plus name) and look at the native-store guard again immediately before acting. They publish `fs:mutation` through path claims (`fs/mutation_events.rs`): operations on the same path, or a path and an ancestor, run one at a time from claim to publish, unrelated ones overlap, and the stream lock is never held across the filesystem call; a failed broadcast is logged and counted and the sequence still advances so windows see a gap. It also carries `discard-begin` (origin window, repository, canonical roots) and `discard-end` for Source Control Discard, and `fs_mutation_sequence` returns the stream's current sequence
- `fs_reconcile_documents` - finds open documents that moved, by identity: a budget per root (100,000 entries or 5 s), ignore files honored, `.git` skipped, the document's former folder walked first (once, only for unresolved documents, inside a shared 5 s deadline); a missing or unauthorized root is skipped; a document without a native version is never bound to a rename destination, and an unresolved one answers `path: null`

#### Clipboard

- `fs_clipboard_paths` - file paths currently on the OS clipboard, for explorer paste

#### Watch

- `fs_watch_add` / `fs_watch_remove` - directory change notifications (`fs:changed`): directories to watch plus the files whose own size or mtime should be reported. macOS uses one FSEvents stream over the covering roots with directory-level events and 0.1 s coalescing; Linux and Windows use non-recursive notify watches. Events are debounced 150 ms, at most 1 s. The call registers every requested path it can and returns `unavailableDirectories` and `unavailableFiles` (with a reason: a deleted folder, an unauthorized one) for the rest; only an unusable environment fails it. The client does not announce unavailable paths and asks for them again on a health refresh or Retry.

#### Search

- `fs_search` - fuzzy file finder (on macOS a root the privacy controls refuse to list fails with that `EPERM` instead of finding nothing; so does `fs_grep_interactive`)
- `fs_list_files` - recursive file listing

#### Grep

- `fs_grep` - content search
- `fs_grep_interactive` - interactive content search
- `fs_glob` - glob matching

### Git (`src-tauri/src/modules/git/`)

All git commands are gated through the workspace authorization registry.

- `git_resolve_repo` / `git_panel_snapshot`
- `git_status` - decoded per NUL record; an entry whose name is not UTF-8 is marked `unreadable` and shown as "Unreadable name", and the backend refuses actions on any entry containing U+FFFD
- `git_diff` / `git_diff_content`
- `git_file_base` - a file's committed (HEAD) text, for the editor's change gutter
- `git_stage` / `git_unstage` / `git_discard_scope` / `git_discard_match` / `git_discard`
- `git_commit`
- `git_fetch` / `git_pull_ff_only` / `git_push`
- `git_log` / `git_show_commit` / `git_commit_files` / `git_commit_file_diff`
- `git_remote_url`
- `git_list_branches` / `git_checkout_branch` - local branches and worktrees, switching
- `git_worktree_add` / `git_worktree_remove` - create a worktree (its folder is authorized) or remove a linked one

### Shell (`src-tauri/src/modules/shell/`)

Three distinct surfaces:

- `shell_run_command` - one-shot subshell exec for AI tools
- `shell_session_open` / `shell_session_run` / `shell_session_close` - persistent agent shell with state across calls
- `shell_bg_spawn` / `shell_bg_logs` / `shell_bg_kill` / `shell_bg_list` - long-running background processes with bounded ring-buffer log capture; `logs` and `kill` take the chat id and refuse a job another chat started, `list` stays process-wide

### Workspace (`src-tauri/src/modules/workspace.rs`)

- `workspace_authorize` / `workspace_current_dir` - the authorization registry behind file commands, spawn cwds, git and the AI tools (`opened`: a folder browsed or a file opened, adding no root an authorized folder covers)
- `wsl_list_distros` / `wsl_default_distro` / `wsl_home` - WSL bridge

### Network (`src-tauri/src/modules/net.rs`, `net/`)

- `ai_http_stream` / `ai_http_cancel` / `ai_http_ack` - AI HTTP proxy with SSRF guard
- `lm_ping` - local-model ping; like AI calls, whether the host may be private is decided natively from the host, not sent by the page
- `markdown_remote_image` - one https image for the Markdown preview (public hosts only, redirects re-validated, images only, 16 MiB)

### AI sessions (`src-tauri/src/modules/ai_sessions.rs`)

- `ai_session_load` / `ai_session_save` / `ai_session_delete` - per-session conversation files, written atomically with a `.bak` copy
- `ai_session_finish_migration` / `ai_session_prune_backup` - migration of conversations stored by older versions

### Skills (`src-tauri/src/modules/skills/`) and project trust (`project_trust.rs`)

- `skills_list` - the skills a conversation in a project may use, or (`all`) every skill with the open projects' trust states, for Settings
- `skills_load` / `skills_read_file` - a usable skill's `SKILL.md` body and file list, or one of its text files, read only inside its real folder
- `skills_set_enabled` / `skills_create` / `skills_edit` / `skills_delete` - turn a skill on or off, create one from the template, open its `SKILL.md` in the editor of the window in front, delete one of Oarlock's folder (to the trash)
- `skills_install_git` / `skills_install_zip` / `skills_install_commit` / `skills_install_cancel` - stage skills from a Git repository or a zip the user picks, then install the reviewed ones
- `project_trust_status` / `project_trust_decide` / `project_trust_list` / `project_trust_revoke` - (the root named must be a folder the workspace registry authorizes) what a project provides (its `AGENTS.md`, its skills, its `.mcp.json`) and the user's decision on each item, kept with its content hash
- `project_memory_read` - the window's project `AGENTS.md` for an AI run, only while the user allows its current content (`project_memory.rs`)

### Language servers (`src-tauri/src/modules/lsp/`)

- `lsp_detect` / `lsp_resolve_root` - find a server binary and the workspace root for a file
- `lsp_spawn` / `lsp_send` / `lsp_kill` - process lifecycle and the framed JSON-RPC pipe
- `lsp_host_pid` - host process id

### MCP servers (`src-tauri/src/modules/mcp/`)

- `mcp_spawn` / `mcp_send` / `mcp_kill` - a local server's process and its newline-delimited JSON-RPC pipe (app windows only; secret environment values read from the keychain here)
- `mcp_http_open` / `mcp_http_close` - a remote server's session: the one origin its requests may reach, and its configured headers (secret values read here)
- `mcp_http_stream` / `mcp_http_cancel` / `mcp_http_ack` - one request of a session through the `net.rs` proxy, streamed like `ai_http_stream`
- `mcp_logs` / `mcp_logs_clear` / `mcp_log_note` - the bounded log of each server (stderr and lifecycle notes)
- `mcp_status_report` / `mcp_status_list` - what each window's client reports, for Settings (`oarlock://mcp-status`)
- `mcp_secret_set` / `mcp_secret_delete` / `mcp_secret_status` - secret values of servers, written from Settings and never read back by a page
- `mcp_oauth_status` / `mcp_oauth_probe` / `mcp_oauth_sign_in` / `mcp_oauth_cancel` / `mcp_oauth_sign_out` - OAuth sign-in of remote servers, run in the backend (settings window only; the page sees a status, never a token; `oarlock://mcp-auth`)
- `mcp_import_scan` / `mcp_import_secrets` - servers other apps configure (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code), read from their fixed paths; secret values go from those files to the keychain without passing the page (settings window only)
- `mcp_project_servers` / `mcp_project_spawn` / `mcp_project_http_open` - the servers of a project's `.mcp.json` while the user allows it: listed for the calling window's project (Settings: every open project), started from the trusted file with its variables expanded in the backend

### Secrets (`src-tauri/src/modules/secrets.rs`)

- `secrets_get` / `secrets_set` / `secrets_delete` / `secrets_get_all` - OS keychain access, service `oarlock-ai` (they refuse the MCP service, `oarlock-mcp`)

### Agent hooks (`src-tauri/src/modules/agent.rs`)

- `agent_enable_hooks` / `agent_hooks_status` - install/status terminal coding-agent hooks (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Pi)

### History (`src-tauri/src/modules/history/`)

- `history_suggest` / `history_commands` / `history_record` / `history_list` - shell history integration

### Settings window

- `get_launch_dir` - the folder Oarlock was launched with (a folder argument, not a launched file's folder), drained on first read
- `get_launch_files` - files the OS asked the calling window to open (CLI args, OS Open With, a later launch), each taken once; `oarlock:open-file` announces new ones
- `open_settings_window` - open the separate settings webview (optional `tab` deep-link)

### App windows (`src-tauri/src/modules/windows.rs`, `quick_terminal.rs`)

- `app_window_open` / `app_window_ready` - open another app window; a page reports that it answers quit requests. Startup restoration resolves a linked data directory once and pins it only when there is recovery work (a journal or a window to adopt); an ordinary launch reads `oarlock-windows.json` without pinning
- `app_quit` / `app_quit_ready` - quit once every window has confirmed and saved its state
- `quick_terminal_toggle` / `quick_terminal_set_hotkey` - the quick terminal window and its global hotkey

### Window presentation (`src-tauri/src/modules/vibrancy.rs`, `window_presentation.rs`)

- `window_backdrop_kind` / `window_set_backdrop` - native window backdrop (vibrancy on macOS, Mica on Windows 11)
- `window_presentation_state` - the calling window's native occlusion, sleep and live-resize state

### macOS privacy (`src-tauri/src/modules/mac_privacy.rs`, macOS only)

- `mac_privacy_status` - whether Oarlock has Full Disk Access, from files only that grant opens (never prompts)
- `mac_privacy_open_settings` - Privacy & Security in System Settings at a named pane (`fullDiskAccess`, `filesAndFolders`); the page never passes a URL

### Terminal clipboard, scrollback and fonts

- `clipboard_image_read` / `clipboard_image_write` - clipboard images as PNG for the Kitty clipboard protocol (`clipboard_image.rs`)
- `terminal_primary_selection_read` / `terminal_primary_selection_write` - the Linux PRIMARY selection (`primary_selection.rs`)
- `terminal_scrollback_save` / `terminal_scrollback_load` / `terminal_scrollback_retain` - saved scrollback per pane (`terminal_scrollback.rs`)
- `system_font_faces` - an installed family's faces, for terminal font features (`system_fonts.rs`)

### CLI control plane

- `control_frontend_ready` - marks the restored main UI ready for routed CLI actions
- `control_respond` - completes a pending UI-bound CLI request

See [CLI control plane](cli-control.md) for the local protocol and packaging model.

## Invariants

- The webview must not spawn processes, read files, or make network calls except through the commands above.
- New commands must be registered in `lib.rs` and guarded at the boundary (workspace auth, deny-list, SSRF, approval flow).
- Plugin permissions must be added to `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` if the command uses a plugin API.
