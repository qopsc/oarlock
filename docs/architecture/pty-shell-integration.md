# PTY shell integration

This guide elaborates on `AGENTS.md`. If anything here conflicts with `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.md` wins.

## Session model

Block sessions keep direct terminal input until OSC 133 confirms prompt input.
Bare shells therefore remain usable. Bash before 4.4 lacks PS0 and emits
`OSC 133;B;oarlock_blocks=0`, retaining its native prompt instead of activating
Oarlock's shared command bar. Shell command labels stay bounded; block rerun uses
the complete command submitted through Oarlock, never a truncated OSC label.

A terminal tab maps to one PTY session. Sessions live in `PtyState` (`src-tauri/src/modules/pty/mod.rs`):

```rust
pub struct PtyState {
    sessions: RwLock<HashMap<u32, Arc<Session>>>,
    next_id: AtomicU32,
}
```

IDs start at 1 and monotonically increase; they are never reused so the frontend can treat `0` as unset.

`pty_open` spawns a session on a blocking thread, registers it with the PTY hub under the calling webview's label, inserts it into the map, and returns the id. Output and exit codes travel over the multiplexed `oarlock-pty` stream (see `pty-transport-v2.md`), not per-PTY channels. `pty_write` accepts raw bytes with an `x-pty-id` header and queues them to the session's writer thread, so a full input pipe cannot block other IPC and write order and I/O errors are preserved.

## Reader / writer / waiter threads, and the hub

`session::spawn_with` starts three small-stack threads per session:

1. **Reader** - reads bytes from the PTY master, runs the DA filter and agent detector (both `memchr`-driven), and pushes filtered bytes into the session's `OutputQueue`. It checks an atomic `closed` flag, not the queue mutex.
2. **Writer** - owns the PTY input. `pty_write` and terminal replies (DA/CPR) share one bounded queue, so input stays ordered and no task is spawned per keystroke.
3. **Waiter** - waits for the child process to exit, joins the reader, hands the exit status to the hub, and waits until the exit frame was delivered.

Delivery belongs to one process-wide **hub thread** (`pty/hub.rs`), not a flusher per PTY. It holds the webview's outstanding `poll` and answers when a terminal is due for its presentation class; see `pty-transport-v2.md` for the wire format, classes and credit.

Output delivery is lossless and credit-based. The frontend acknowledges a
chunk only after Ghostty has synchronously parsed it.
Native pending plus in-flight data is capped at 2 MiB per terminal, with at most
1 MiB (128 chunks) in flight. When either limit is reached, the reader stops draining the
PTY and lets the operating system apply backpressure. No terminal bytes or
partial escape sequences are discarded during normal delivery or acknowledgment retries.

Acknowledgements are cumulative parsed-byte offsets, not credit deltas, and
ride on the next `poll`. Rust validates them against delivered chunk boundaries.
Duplicate and stale counts do nothing; an invalid boundary fails that terminal.
The frontend retains unconfirmed progress and resends it after a failed request
with capped backoff. A stuck parser is visible after five seconds. A parser error
never returns credit for unconsumed bytes.

Reader completion and queue wakeups share the same mutex, preventing missed
EOF notifications. Neither child exit nor EOF bypasses the byte or message
limits. The exit frame is sent only after the final parser acknowledgment;
registration checks completed draining rather than mere child exit.

On Windows the waiter closes the ConPTY master on its own thread while the
reader continues through EOF, including the final frame emitted during close.
Explicit user close releases queue waiters and drains unwanted pipe bytes until
EOF. This follows the [ClosePseudoConsole contract](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/closepseudoconsole)
and avoids the previous 50 ms final-output heuristic. Windows runtime testing
remains a release gate.

## Shell bootstrapping

`shell_init::build_command` builds the `CommandBuilder` used to spawn the shell. The path and arguments depend on the platform and the selected workspace environment (Local or a WSL distro).

### Unix

Integration scripts live in `src-tauri/src/modules/pty/scripts/`:

- `zshenv.zsh`, `zprofile.zsh`, `zlogin.zsh`, `zshrc.zsh` for zsh
- `bashrc.bash` for bash
- `init.fish` for fish, staged in the active Oarlock profile and sourced on launch

Zsh is launched as a login shell with `ZDOTDIR` pointing at `~/.cache/oarlock/shell-integration/zsh`, whose four files each source the user's matching file (`.zshrc` then installs Oarlock's hooks). While a user file runs, `ZDOTDIR` is the user's own (`OARLOCK_USER_ZDOTDIR`, or unset), so `$ZDOTDIR/conf.d/*` loaders and `${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zsh_history` resolve as in any terminal; a `ZDOTDIR` the user's `.zshenv` sets (the XDG layout) is carried to the later files in `OARLOCK_USER_ZDOTDIR`, and `ZDOTDIR` points back at the wrapper so zsh keeps loading it. A `HISTFILE` derived from the wrapper directory (macOS `/etc/zshrc` runs before our `.zshrc`) is moved to the user's directory before their `.zshrc`; zsh then reads it once, as usual. The scenarios run against a real zsh in `shell_init.rs` tests (skipped when zsh is missing). Bash uses `--rcfile` with a wrapper that sources the user's `~/.bashrc` after Oarlock's. Fish loads the profile-specific script through its launch command (`-C`) rather than installing a global `conf.d` hook, so unrelated or nested fish sessions do not load Oarlock integration. Fish also starts as a login shell (`-l`, locally and in WSL), since only a login fish runs its `path_helper` emulation that adds `/etc/paths` and `/etc/paths.d` (Homebrew) on macOS; zsh gets the same from `/etc/zprofile`, bash from the `/etc/profile` its rcfile sources.

All integrated shells emit **OSC 7** (cwd) and **OSC 133 A/B/C/D** (prompt boundaries and exit code) so Oarlock can track cwd and detect command boundaries without parsing the user's prompt. OSC 7 is still terminal output that any program can print, so a report becomes the terminal's folder (and an authorized root) only through `pty_authorize_cwd`, which on Linux and macOS checks it against the folder the OS reports for the shell or its foreground job (`pty/cwd.rs`, see the security model).

### Windows

On Windows the shell priority is:

1. `pwsh.exe` (PowerShell 7+)
2. `powershell.exe` (Windows PowerShell 5.1)
3. `cmd.exe` (`cmd /k profile.cmd`: OSC 7 and OSC 133 D/A/B around the user's `PROMPT`; no OSC 133 C, so block tabs keep its prompt with `oarlock_blocks=0`)

PowerShell loads `profile.ps1` via:

```text
pwsh -NoLogo -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <profile.ps1>
```

The profile wraps the user's existing `prompt` function to emit OSC 7 + OSC 133 A/B/D after `$PROFILE` runs. It probes or initialises every variable it reads, so a `Set-StrictMode` left on by `$PROFILE` cannot break it. The exit code in OSC 133 D is 0 when `$?` is true, else `$LASTEXITCODE` when it is non-zero, else 1: `$LASTEXITCODE` belongs to the last native command, so on its own it would mark every later successful cmdlet as failed. The prompt puts `$LASTEXITCODE` back afterwards. A test runs the profile in `pwsh` or Windows PowerShell when one is installed. The cwd is normalized to backslashes before being passed to ConPTY because `CreateProcessW` misbehaves with forward slashes.

### Fish 4.0+

Fish 4.0 writes its own OSC 133 prompt markers. To avoid doubling, Oarlock sets `fish_features=no-mark-prompt` and re-asserts its own prompt via `-C` after `config.fish` runs.

### Terminal identity

Every PTY shell gets `TERM=xterm-256color`, `COLORTERM=truecolor`, `TERM_PROGRAM=oarlock` and `TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION=<app version>` (the terminal core answers XTVERSION with the same `oarlock <version>`), plus `OARLOCK_TERMINAL=1`. A WSL shell receives them through `WSLENV`, which names the only Windows variables WSL passes into a distro.

An Oarlock started from another terminal inherits that terminal's identity, so `terminal_env::inherited_identity` (`pty/terminal_env.rs`, pure and tested) removes it before the shell starts: `TERM_PROGRAM`, `TERM_SESSION_ID`, `WINDOWID`, `COLORFGBG`, the `GHOSTTY_*`, `ITERM*`/`LC_TERMINAL*`, `KITTY_*`, `WEZTERM_*`, `ALACRITTY_*`, `KONSOLE_*`, VTE (`VTE_VERSION`, GNOME Terminal, Ptyxis, Tilix, Terminator), xterm, JetBrains and Windows Terminal variables, VS Code's injected `VSCODE_*`, tmux/screen/Zellij session variables, and a parent Oarlock's `OARLOCK_*` session variables. Left behind, they make macOS `/etc/zshrc` source `/etc/zshrc_$TERM_PROGRAM`, VS Code's manual shell integration load, `vte.sh` install its prompt hooks, tools wrap output for a tmux that is not there, and `wezterm cli`, `kitten @` or `code` drive the other terminal. Generic variables go only when they hold the launcher's own value: `TERMINFO` inside Ghostty's or kitty's installation, iTerm2's `TERMINFO_DIRS`, and VS Code's `GIT_ASKPASS`/`GIT_EDITOR` helpers, which fail without its IPC. User configuration (`PATH`, locale, `XDG_*`, `MANPATH`, a tool's config location such as `KITTY_CONFIG_DIRECTORY` or `WEZTERM_CONFIG_FILE`, `OARLOCK_USER_ZDOTDIR`) is never removed. One-shot AI commands and background processes run on pipes, not a terminal, and keep Oarlock's environment as is.

## Concurrency and process lifetime on Windows

### `CONPTY_LIFECYCLE_LOCK`

`openpty + spawn_command` and the corresponding close are serialized by a static mutex in `session.rs`. Concurrent ConPTY lifecycle calls corrupt the new console so its shell never pumps output.

`ClosePseudoConsole` blocks until the reader has taken everything conhost still holds, and the reader can be waiting for output credit the frontend has not granted yet. Holding the lock through that wait would stall every other `pty_open` for up to the 30 s drain deadline. `close_pseudoconsole` therefore lets the reader overdraft its queue by 1 MiB first, outside the lock, and only then takes the lock around the close itself.

### Job Object

Each ConPTY child is assigned to a Windows Job Object with `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` (`proc::job::ProcessJob`, `src-tauri/src/modules/proc/job.rs`). When the Job HANDLE drops - clean shutdown, panic, or even a SIGKILL'd Oarlock process - the kernel kills every descendant of the shell. Without this, `TerminateProcess` only kills the immediate child and `npm run dev` started inside pwsh would be orphaned.

On macOS and Linux, `Drop for Session` calls `killer.kill()`. Dev `Ctrl-C` of `cargo run` can still leave orphans because destructors may not run; that is acceptable for development only.

## Input and escape-sequence handling

### DA filter

PowerShell / PSReadLine sends a cursor-position query (`ESC[6n`) at startup and blocks until it gets an answer. The `DaFilter` (`da_filter.rs`) intercepts that query and replies on the PTY input so the shell does not hang.

### Agent detection

The reader thread runs an `AgentDetector` (`agent_detect.rs`) over the byte stream. It is armed by `OSC 133;C;<cmd>` (a listed agent command) or by a self-armed `OSC 777` marker (any agent name, sanitized to plain display text) and emits `oarlock:agent-signal` transitions (`started`, `working`, `attention`, `finished`, `exited`). Detection is driven only by OSC sequences, never by raw output, so a repainting TUI never flaps.

### Enter key

Terminal input sends `\r` (CR), not `\n` (LF). PowerShell on Windows requires CR.

## Invariants

- Do not remove `CONPTY_LIFECYCLE_LOCK` without verifying first-tab stability under fast tab spam.
- Never hold `CONPTY_LIFECYCLE_LOCK` across a wait that depends on the frontend (credit, acknowledgements).
- Do not disable the Job Object without a replacement orphan guard on Windows.
- Keep platform-specific shell logic in the matching `#[cfg(unix)]` or `#[cfg(windows)]` arm of `shell_init.rs`.
- cwd passed to ConPTY must use backslashes; OSC 7 cwd arriving at the frontend is forward-slash canonical.
