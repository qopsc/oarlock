/**
 * AI tool definitions.
 *
 * Approval policy (`TOOL_GATES` below):
 *  - Read-only tools (`read_file`, `list_directory`, `grep`, `glob`)
 *    auto-execute, but go through the security guard which refuses obvious
 *    secret paths (.env*, .ssh/, credentials, etc.).
 *  - Mutating tools (file writes and edits, shell commands, coding agents)
 *    require explicit user approval in Ask mode: the AI SDK pauses on
 *    tool-call and surfaces a `tool-approval-request` part that the UI
 *    renders as a confirmation card. Auto-approve runs file and shell tools
 *    without the card; their deny-lists still refuse in `execute`.
 *  - `edit` / `multi_edit` additionally enforce a read-before-edit invariant
 *    (the model must have called read_file on the path earlier in the
 *    session).
 *  - Tools of MCP servers (`mcp__<server>__<tool>`, added per run by
 *    `runAgentStream`) ask in every mode unless the server is Trusted; see
 *    `mcpToolGate`. Sub-agents never get them.
 *  - `use_skill` / `read_skill_file` read only inside the folders of the
 *    run's usable skills (`skills`), which the backend confines; skill scripts
 *    run through `bash_run` with its approval.
 *
 * The model sees absolute paths only after they are resolved against the
 * active terminal's cwd (provided via `getCwd`); it should not invent paths
 * outside that.

 *  - `approvable`: changes files. Asks in Ask mode and runs unasked in
 *    Auto-approve; `execute` still refuses protected paths, and plan mode
 *    queues the change for review instead of writing it.
 *  - `approvable-outside-plan`: runs shell commands. As `approvable`, except
 *    that plan mode, which must not run commands, keeps asking. `execute`
 *    still refuses the command deny-list.
 *  - `always`: launches or messages a coding agent, which no deny-list
 *    covers, so the user's approval is the only gate: asks in every mode.
 *  - `mcp`: a tool of an MCP server the user has not marked Trusted. The
 *    server is an outside program or service, so it asks in every mode.
 *  - `mcp-trusted`: a tool of a Trusted server. Follows the conversation's
 *    mode as a shell command does: plan mode, which must not act, asks.
 * MCP tools are gated by `mcpToolGate`, from what the user chose for the
 * server and the tool; the server's own annotations (`readOnlyHint` and the
 * like) are never an input, so a server cannot talk its way past a gate.
