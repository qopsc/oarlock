Oarlock is a lightweight open-source terminal-first AI-native development environment (ADE) built on Tauri 2 + Rust and React 19. A native PTY backend with a libghostty-vt terminal drawn by WebGPU (WebGL as the fallback), an agentic AI side-panel that runs against your own keys or fully local models, plus a code editor, file explorer, source control with a git graph, and a web preview pane built in. No telemetry. No account.

## Features

### Terminal

- libghostty-vt terminal core with a WebGPU renderer (WebGL fallback), multi-tab with background streaming
- GPU-accelerated block-based terminal with editor-like command input
- Native PTY backend via `portable-pty` (zsh, bash, pwsh, fish, cmd)
- Split panels (horizontal and vertical)
- Inline search, link detection, true-color, Kitty graphics and keyboard protocols
- Drag files from the explorer or desktop into a terminal as shell-safe quoted paths
- The `oarlock` command in native terminal panes opens a file in the editor of the window it runs in
- Per-tab workspace environments on Windows (Local, or any installed WSL distro)
- Spaces restore tabs, working directories, and split layouts across launches

### Code editor

- CodeMirror 6 (supports all popular languages - TS/JS, Rust, Python, Go, C/C++, Java, HTML/CSS, JSON, Markdown, etc.)
- Inline AI autocomplete with local model support
- AI edit diffs, accept or reject hunk by hunk
- Opt-in language server support with diagnostics, navigation, completion, formatting, and custom servers
- Rendered Markdown plus image, video, audio, and PDF viewing
- Vim mode
- Built-in editor themes including Kanagawa, Catppuccin, Rosé Pine, Everforest, Dracula, Solarized, Nord, Tokyo Night, GitHub, and Xcode

### Source control

- Stage / unstage hunks, commit (Cmd+Enter / Ctrl+Enter), push with upstream awareness
- Branch display including detached HEAD state
- Git history pane with a real commit graph (lane rendering for merges and branches)
- Commit search and filter, click through to the remote commit page

### File explorer

- Catppuccin icon theme
- Fuzzy search, keyboard navigation, inline rename, context actions
- Live updates when files change on disk
- Attach files and selections directly to the AI side-panel

### Web preview

- Auto-detects local dev servers and opens them in a preview tab
- External URL preview via a native child webview

### Themes and customization

- Custom themes built in-app, switch between bundled presets and your own
- Create your own themes and share them as `.oarlock-theme` files, or import Ghostty, iTerm2, Alacritty and Windows Terminal color schemes
- Background images with adjustable opacity and blur
- Editor theme is independent from the app theme

### AI

- **BYOK providers:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Google (Gemini), Groq, xAI (Grok), Cerebras, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Mistral, plus any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **Local / offline:** LM Studio, MLX, Ollama
- **Agentic workflow:** plans, sub-agents, file read / write / edit / multi-edit / grep / glob, bash with approval gating, background processes
- **Project instructions and skills:** a project's `AGENTS.md`, its skills (`.claude/skills`, `.oarlock/skills`) and its `.mcp.json` servers are used once you allow them, and asked about again when they change
- **MCP servers:** local and remote Model Context Protocol servers, each tool call approved unless you trust the server
- **Coding-agent orchestration:** spawn Claude Code in a terminal, inspect its output, and send follow-up work through approval-gated tools
- **Composer:** prompt snippets via `#handle`, files via `@path`, voice input, attach-to-agent from explorer or selection
- **Custom agents** with their own system prompt and tool subset
- **Plan mode** for multi-step work, generates and confirms before doing

## Install

There are no releases yet: until the first one, build Oarlock from source (below). Releases will be published on the [Releases](https://github.com/qopsc/oarlock/releases) page with builds for macOS and Linux; Windows builds from source. Updates are not set up yet, so a build does not update itself.

### Windows notes

- Default shell detection: `pwsh.exe` (PowerShell 7+) -> `powershell.exe` (Windows PowerShell 5.1) -> `cmd.exe`.
- WSL is a first-class workspace environment, not a wrapped subprocess.

### Linux notes

- **NixOS / Nix** (once the first release is out; the flake installs release builds): `nix profile install github:qopsc/oarlock` (non-NixOS), or import the flake and add `inputs.oarlock.packages.${pkgs.system}.oarlock` to `environment.systemPackages` (NixOS). The `nixosModules.oarlock` output is also available for a simpler setup.
- **AppImage:** needs FUSE. Without it: `./Oarlock_*.AppImage --appimage-extract-and-run`. On Wayland with rendering glitches, try `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1`. Otherwise the `.deb` / `.rpm` packages link against the system GTK stack and tend to be smoother.

## Configure AI

1. Open **Settings -> AI**.
2. Pick a provider and paste your API key. For local inference, point Oarlock at your LM Studio / MLX / Ollama endpoint.
3. Keys go to the OS keychain (the macOS Keychain, the Windows Credential Manager); on Linux they go to a file in the app's data folder that only your user can read. They never go to localStorage or the logs.

Custom and local AI requests follow redirects only within the configured URL's
scheme, host and port. If a redirect is refused, configure the final API endpoint
URL instead. Native AI, MCP, OAuth, local-model probes and Markdown image requests
connect directly and ignore environment and OS HTTP proxy settings so their
validated DNS addresses remain authoritative. Proxy-only networks are currently
unsupported for those requests. Built-in providers using browser requests retain
the webview's networking behavior.

Native DNS resolution uses your system configuration and waits up to 10 seconds.
It allows 8 active lookups and 32 waiting callers, reporting a busy error beyond
that. Cancelling a request cannot kill a running system lookup; it remains counted
until it returns.

Connection probes have a 5-second total deadline, preview images 20 seconds,
and each OAuth HTTP operation 30 seconds. These include DNS, redirects and
response reads; a probe finishes at response headers. Interactive sign-in still
allows five minutes for completing the browser flow.
Endpoint Test probes cancel when you change the URL, retest, collapse or close
the card, or reload or close Settings. Up to eight run across the app at once;
additional tests report a busy error without consuming chat request slots.
Automatic MCP sign-in discovery has its own eight-request limit and a bounded
Settings queue. Closing Settings, editing or disabling a server, or starting an
authentication action cancels its unfinished discovery. Failures show Retry
discovery; temporary server errors are not treated as missing metadata.

Browse Models allows up to 30 seconds for the complete response and rejects lists
over 4 MiB, 2,000 entries or 1,024 characters per model ID with an explicit error.
Closing or hiding a Markdown preview releases its remote images and cancels loads
that no other preview needs. Unused images retain at most 32 entries and 32 MiB of
encoded image data per window; visible images are not evicted by this idle budget.

## Build from source

**Prerequisites**
- Rust (stable), https://rustup.rs
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.4.3+
- Tauri prerequisites for your platform, https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/

**Run**
```bash
bun install
bun run tauri dev       # development
bun run tauri build     # local release bundle
```

On macOS, local builds without an Apple signing identity include an ad-hoc-signed
Git helper that refuses execution. Distribution builds must set
`OARLOCK_DISTRIBUTION_BUILD=1`, provide `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` and `APPLE_TEAM_ID`,
and verify the signed app with `scripts/git-worker/verify-app.mjs`. The release
workflow enforces this policy. Local ad-hoc signing does not enable isolated Git
execution.

**Checks**
```bash
bun run lint
bun run check-types
bun run test
cd src-tauri && cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings   # Rust lint (matches CI)
cd src-tauri && cargo nextest run --locked                           # or: cargo test --locked
```
